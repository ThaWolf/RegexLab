# RegexLab Project Analysis & Planning

## Background and Motivation

The RegexLab project has successfully completed its primary language change initiative, converting all user-facing text from Spanish to English. However, user feedback has identified two critical issues that need immediate attention:

1raining Page Issue**: The training page shows no premise or instructions - just a blank input field and "Incorrect" validation result
2Documentation Page Issue**: The docs page is minimal and not helpful for users

**NEW INSIGHT**: Based on the "Regular Expressions 101eference and Quick Reference image, we now have a clear vision of what a professional regex playground should include. The Quick Reference shows the exact structure we need for comprehensive regex documentation and learning.

**TRANSFORMATIVE VISION**: Transform RegexLab into an RPG-style regex learning platform where users progress through increasingly difficult challenges, earn badges, and advance through a structured roadmap. This captures the spirit of regex101's interactive learning approach while creating a unique, engaging experience.

These issues significantly impact the user experience and functionality of the application.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Training Page Problems
- **Root Cause**: The training page is not displaying exercise premises/prompts
- **Technical Issues**: 
  - Backend may not be returning training exercises properly
  - Frontend may not be rendering the exercise content correctly
  - Database may lack seed data for training exercises
- **User Impact**: Users cannot understand what theyre supposed to do, making the training feature unusable

### Documentation Page Problems
- **Root Cause**: The documentation page lacks comprehensive content
- **Content Gaps**:
  - No clear explanation of what RegexLab is
  - Missing usage instructions for Regex Tester
  - No guidance on how to use Training mode
  - Lack of example patterns and explanations
  - No FAQ or troubleshooting section
- **User Impact**: New users cannot learn to use the application effectively

### RPG-Style Training System Vision (NEW)
- **Core Concept**: Interactive learning tool to improve regex understanding through progressive challenges
- **RPG Elements**:
  - **Level System**: Easy → Medium → Hard progression with XP gains
  - **Roadmap Structure**: Visual progression path showing unlocked/locked challenges
  - **Badge System**: Achievement badges for completing challenges, efficiency, creativity
  - **Leaderboards**: Statistics showing how well others performed on each task
  - **Progressive Difficulty**: Less hand-holding as users advance
- **Learning Philosophy**:
  - Focus on fundamentals and powerful regex writing
  - Tasks may not always represent best practices but teach core concepts
  - PCRE2 engine evaluation for consistency
  - Continuous improvement encouraged (shorter solutions, higher leaderboard positions)

### Professional Regex Playground Standards (Based on Reference)
