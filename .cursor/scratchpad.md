# RegexLab Project Analysis & Planning

## Background and Motivation

The RegexLab project has successfully completed its primary language change initiative, converting all user-facing text from Spanish to English. However, user feedback has identified critical issues that need immediate attention:

1. **Authentication Flow Issue**: NextAuth is not working properly - sign-in redirects to error page with 404
2. **Training Page Issue**: The training page shows no premise or instructions - just a blank input field and "Incorrect" validation result
3. **Documentation Page Issue**: The docs page is minimal and not helpful for users

**CRITICAL AUTHENTICATION PROBLEM**: Despite fixing import paths and TypeScript configuration, the authentication flow is still broken. Users clicking "Sign In" are redirected to `/api/auth/error` with a 404 error, indicating fundamental issues with the NextAuth setup.

**NEW INSIGHT**: Based on the "Regular Expressions 101" reference and Quick Reference image, we now have a clear vision of what a professional regex playground should include. The Quick Reference shows the exact structure we need for comprehensive regex documentation and learning.

**TRANSFORMATIVE VISION**: Transform RegexLab into an RPG-style regex learning platform where users progress through increasingly difficult challenges, earn badges, and advance through a structured roadmap. This captures the spirit of regex101's interactive learning approach while creating a unique, engaging experience.

These issues significantly impact the user experience and functionality of the application.

## Detailed Technical Analysis & Action Plan

### üîç Authentication Flow Investigation Required

**Current State Analysis**:
1. **Route Handler**: `app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts` exists but may not be working
2. **Configuration**: `lib/auth.ts` has NextAuth options but may have conflicts
3. **Environment**: All variables set correctly via Vercel CLI
4. **Build**: Frontend builds successfully without errors
5. **Deployment**: Changes are deployed but auth still fails

**Specific Issues to Investigate**:
1. **NextAuth Route Recognition**: Verify Next.js recognizes the catch-all route
2. **Handler Export**: Ensure GET/POST handlers are properly exported
3. **Configuration Conflicts**: Check if explicit page routes are causing issues
4. **Error Handling**: Add proper error pages for auth failures
5. **OAuth Configuration**: Verify Google OAuth setup is correct

**Immediate Action Items**:
1. **Remove Conflicting Config**: Remove explicit page routes from NextAuth config
2. **Add Error Pages**: Create proper error handling pages
3. **Simplify Configuration**: Use default NextAuth behavior
4. **Add Debugging**: Include debug mode for troubleshooting
5. **Test Locally**: Verify auth works in development environment

**Expected Outcome**: After these fixes, clicking "Sign In" should redirect to Google OAuth instead of the error page.
