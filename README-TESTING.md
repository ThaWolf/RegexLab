# RegexLab Testing Guide

## Quick Start - Test the Regex Functionality

### Option 1: Local HTTP Server (Recommended)
1. **Start the local server:**
   ```bash
   python3 serve-test.py
   ```

2. **Open in browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:8080/test-regex.html
   ```

3. **Test the functionality:**
   - Click "Test Health Endpoint" to verify API connection
   - Click "Load Common Patterns" to see available regex patterns
   - Try "Explain Pattern" with a regex like `^\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}$`
   - Test regex matching with sample text

### Option 2: Direct File (May have CORS issues)
1. **Open the file directly:**
   ```bash
   open test-regex.html
   ```
   
   **Note:** This may show "Failed to fetch" errors due to CORS policy.

## What's Working

✅ **Backend API** (Railway): All regex endpoints functional
- `/api/regex/health` - Health check
- `/api/regex/patterns` - Common regex patterns
- `/api/regex/explain` - Pattern explanation
- `/api/regex/test` - Regex testing

✅ **CORS Support**: Backend allows requests from any origin

✅ **Test Interface**: Complete HTML interface for testing all functionality

## Features Available

### Regex Explanation
- Detailed breakdown of regex components
- Component descriptions and positions
- Warnings for potential issues

### Regex Testing
- Real-time pattern matching
- Match highlighting
- Position tracking
- Multiple flag support

### Common Patterns
- Email validation
- Phone number patterns
- Date formats
- URL validation
- Credit card patterns

## Troubleshooting

**If you see "Failed to fetch":**
- Use the local HTTP server (Option 1)
- Check that the backend is running on Railway
- Verify your internet connection

**If the server won't start:**
- Check if port 8080 is in use
- Try a different port in `serve-test.py`
- Ensure Python 3 is installed

## Next Steps

The regex functionality is fully working! You can:
1. Test all features using the interface
2. Use the API endpoints directly
3. Integrate with your own applications
4. Continue with frontend development

## API Endpoints

All endpoints are available at: `https://passionate-courage-production.up.railway.app/api/regex/`

- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /patterns` - Common patterns
- `POST /explain` - Explain regex pattern
- `POST /test` - Test regex against text
